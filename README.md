# TensorFlow-Image-Models

This is a port of 
[PyTorch Image Models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) to Tensorflow.

Work in progress...

## Datasets and evaluation

### ImageNet validation split

To be able to use the ImageNet validation split, we need to manually download and
copy `ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar` to `~/tensorflow_datasets/downloads/manual/` and then run
```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

tfds.builder("imagenet2012_real").download_and_prepare()
```
Then we have access to both original and reassessed (ReaL) labels under the keys
`original_label` and `real_label`. We use `imagenet2012_real`, because to process the 
`imagenet2012` dataset via `tensorflow-datasets` requires us to download validation
_and_ train splits, even though we don't intend to use train (for now).

Having downloaded `ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar`, we can also access `imagenet2012_corrupted`
via `tensorflow-datasets`.

Other ImageNet variants, such as
- ImageNet-A (`imagenet_a`)
- ImageNet-R (`imagenet_r`) and
- ImageNet-v2 (`imagenet_v2`, defaults to matched-frequency)
can be downloaded automatically via `tensorflow-datasets`.
